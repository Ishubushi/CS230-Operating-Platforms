# CS230-Operating-Platforms
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room our client wanted a web application to be developed for their game Draw it or Lose It. They are interested in expanding their gaming app to multiple platforms using various software patterns in a distributed environment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I thought providing the client with the various operating platforms was beneficial for their understanding and then recommending what operating platform to utilize.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I thought that understanding the various architectural design patterns was crucial to finding the right idea on how to scale this application for the client.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would choose to enhance the object oriented principles more and give a better detailed version of those principles to the client and how it relates to the scalability of the application.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  By trying to put their project into an executive summary format, this helps eliminate un-necessary information and focus on trying to put into words what the client is actually needing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I approached designing the software by understanding the needs of the client and based on their needs which platform would be best to consider designing it for. Although the client
  needs are to have a diverse platform base for their game it is best to have it built on one platform that has the option to scale to many.
